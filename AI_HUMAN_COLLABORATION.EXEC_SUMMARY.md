| UI Composition | Monolithic regions | Component seams | Refactor safety |
| Scenario Execution | Manual setups | Seeded harness | Reproducibility |
| Pace Control | Auto phase advance | Acceptance gating | Player agency |
| Transparency | Console logs | Layered rationale | Debug speed |
| Evolution Strategy | Direct edits | Parallel audited fork | Reversibility |

## 4. Collaboration Pattern Highlights
| Pattern | Impact | Example Realization |
| ------- | ------ | ------------------- |
| Interaction Contract | Prevented UX/logic entanglement | Modal dismissal → accept phase |
| Problem Surfacing Loop | Reduced misalignment & rework | Friction → options → commit |
| Reversible Evolution | Enabled safe innovation | Rewrite path + parity matrices |
| Transparency Stack | Built player & dev trust | Decision modal + tree UI |
| Capacity Fabric | Allowed later rapid shifts | Silent sprints (Days 7–10) |
| Cognitive Ease Layer | Lowered mental load | Unified modals, overlays, pacing |
| Deterministic Confidence Loop | Safe iteration acceleration | Hash baseline + scenarios |

## 5. Key Inflection Points
- Day 11: Integrity baseline marks trust shift from assumption to verification.
- Day 14: Parallel rewrite lane enables strategic refactor without halting feature work.
- Day 17: Decision modal catalyzes transparency-first interaction philosophy.
- Day 18: Acceptance mechanic formalizes user pace governance.
- Day 23: Scenario + decision tree closes observability loop (predict → act → explain).

## 6. Outcome Synthesis
The project achieved: platform-level modularity, decision explainability, player pacing control, ergonomic interaction stability, and a foundation for future AI heuristic tuning without architectural churn.
