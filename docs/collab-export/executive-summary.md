# Executive Summary
(Condensed – see full `AI_HUMAN_COLLABORATION.md` for narrative detail.)

## Overview
Human–AI collaboration evolved a digital board game into an experimentation platform emphasizing transparency, reversible evolution, comfort UX, and deterministic scenarios.

## Phases & Highlights
(Refer to Phased Milestones table in main executive summary file.)

## Architectural Evolution
Legacy → dual-lane rewrite enabled safe structural modernization (see `architecture-shifts.md`).

## Core Patterns
Interaction contract, problem surfacing loop, reversible evolution, transparency stack, capacity fabric, deterministic confidence loop.

## Forward Arc
Heuristic tuning panel, batch simulation harness, visual diff integrity tool, accessibility modes, analytics timeline, multiplayer seed.
