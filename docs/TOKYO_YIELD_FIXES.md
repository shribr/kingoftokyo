# Tokyo Yield Modal & Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. 🎲 **CPU Infinite Rolling Bug**
- **Problem**: CPU could get infinite rerolls due to unsafe while loop
- **Solution**: Added safety guard; base total rolls = 3 (1 initial + 2 rerolls) but now respects reroll bonus modifiers (cards can increase this)
- **Code**: Enhanced `playCpuTurn()` with roll tracking and comprehensive logging

### 2. 🏯 **Missing Tokyo Yield Modal** 
- **Problem**: Human players had no UI to decide whether to leave Tokyo when attacked
- **Solution**: Created complete Tokyo yield decision modal system
- **Components**:
  - `tokyo-yield-modal.component.js` - Modal logic with legacy-style UI
  - `components.tokyo-yield-modal.css` (removed Oct 1 2025) - legacy styling replaced by unified `yield-modal.css`
  - Integrated with `yieldDecision` state slice
  - 10-second decision window with fallback

### 3. 📊 **Stats Not Updating in Tokyo Areas**
- **Problem**: Player cards in Tokyo City/Bay didn't refresh when stats changed
- **Solution**: Fixed arena component state subscription
- **Code**: Arena now subscribes to `["meta", "players", "tokyo"]` instead of just `["meta"]`
- **Result**: Tokyo cards automatically refresh when player stats change

### 4. 🔧 **Enhanced Debugging**
- Added comprehensive logging for:
  - CPU turn roll counting and limits
  - Tokyo yield prompt creation 
  - Modal show/hide events
  - Player stat updates

## New Tokyo Yield Modal Features:

### UI Design (Legacy Recreation)
- Dark red warning background with pattern
- Gold "TOKYO UNDER ATTACK!" header
- Damage preview showing health before/after
- Two animated buttons: "Stay in Tokyo" (green) vs "Leave Tokyo" (red)
- Mobile responsive design

### Behavior  
- Appears automatically when human player in Tokyo is attacked
- 10-second decision window (extended from 5s)
- Click overlay defaults to "Stay" (safer choice)
- Integrates with existing `yieldPromptDecided` action system
- Auto-hides when decision made or no pending prompts
 - Dice roll budget now computed dynamically via `computeMaxRolls(state, activePlayerId)` (base 3 + bonuses)

## Testing Checklist:

✅ **CPU Turns**: Should complete within allowed roll budget (base 3; +bonus from reroll-granting power cards)
✅ **Human Player Stats**: Should update immediately in both panels and Tokyo areas  
✅ **Tokyo Yield**: Human players should see modal when attacked in Tokyo
✅ **Card Movement**: Should finish before next turn starts
✅ **Debugging**: Console should show clear flow of events
