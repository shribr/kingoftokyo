# Chat History Reconstruction - Session 005
*Date: October 3, 2025*

## Session Overview
This session continued the King of Tokyo game migration work from the previous sessions, focusing on completing the component migration from legacy CSS selectors to modern component-scoped styling. The main objectives were to finish migrating remaining components and begin the CSS cleanup phase.

## Key Issues Addressed

### 1. Missing Monster Images in Setup Screen
**Problem**: While monster images appeared correctly on the splash screen, they were missing from the monster selection screen during setup.

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- All image assets exist correctly in `new/images/characters/` directory
- `new/config.json` contains correct relative paths like `"image": "images/characters/king_of_tokyo_the_king.png"`
- Both splash and setup screens use identical image rendering patterns
- Issue identified as a potential timing/race condition where setup renders before monsters are loaded from config.json

**Proposed Solution**:
- Add safety checks and re-render logic to setup component
- Track monster count changes and trigger re-renders when monsters load
- Add defensive checks for missing image assets

### 2. Visual Parity Concerns
**Issue**: The new UI styling doesn't match the original game's appearance during the migration phase.

**Explanation**: This is expected behavior during the "skeletal functional migration" phase where:
- Legacy structural classes have been removed
- Component-scoped CSS is partially implemented
- Visual theming/polish is intentionally deferred until after structural cleanup
- Some components still rely on partial or not-yet-migrated styling layers

## Migration Progress Completed

### Components Successfully Migrated
All major components have been migrated from legacy classes to component-scoped styling:

1. **Arena Component** (`arena.component.js`)
   - Removed: `.game-board`, `.tokyo-area`, `.tokyo-city`, `.tokyo-bay`, `.round-indicator-container`
   - Added: `.cmp-arena` + data attributes (`data-arena-section`, `data-tokyo`, `data-round-indicator`)
   - Status: ✅ Complete

2. **Dice Tray Component** (`dice-tray.component.js`)
   - Removed: `.dice-area`, `.draggable`
   - Added: `.cmp-dice-tray` + `data-draggable`
   - Status: ✅ Complete

3. **Action Menu Component** (`action-menu.component.js`)
   - Removed: `.action-menu`, `.draggable`, legacy `.btn`
   - Added: `.cmp-action-menu`, `k-btn` system, `data-draggable`
   - Status: ✅ Complete

4. **Toolbar Component** (`toolbar.component.js`)
   - Removed: `.game-toolbar`
   - Added: `.cmp-toolbar` + `data-draggable`
   - Status: ✅ Complete

5. **Player Card List Component** (`player-card-list.component.js`)
   - Removed: `.players-area`, `.collapsible-panel`, `.monsters-panel`
   - Added: `.cmp-panel-root` + `data-panel="monsters"`, `data-collapsed` attributes
   - Status: ✅ Complete

6. **Card Shop Component** (`card-shop.component.js`)
   - Removed: `.cards-area`, `.collapsible-panel`, `.card-shop-panel`, legacy `.btn`
   - Added: `.cmp-panel-root` + `data-panel="card-shop"`, `data-collapsed`, `k-btn` system
   - Status: ✅ Complete

### CSS Architecture Changes

#### New Component Stylesheets Created:
- `components.panel.css` - Universal panel system with collapse functionality
- `components.toolbar.css` - Toolbar-specific styling
- `components.dice-tray.css` - Dice tray layout and animations
- `components.action-menu.css` - Action menu button clustering
- `components.buttons.css` - New `k-btn` button system
- `components.arena.css` - Game board and Tokyo area styling
- `components.ai-thought-bubble.css` - AI decision display styling

#### Legacy CSS Annotations:
All deprecated selectors have been marked with `/* LEGACY [COMPONENT] SELECTOR (DEPRECATED) */` comments in:
- `css/legacy/layout.css`
- `css/legacy/responsive.css`
- `css/legacy/base.css`
- `css/layout.css`
- `css/responsive.css`
- `css/base.css`

## Technical Architecture Updates

### New Component Patterns Established:
1. **Data Attribute Driven**: Components use `data-*` attributes instead of class-based selectors
   - `data-draggable` for draggable elements
   - `data-collapsed` for collapsible panels
   - `data-panel` for panel identification
   - `data-arena-section` for game board areas

2. **Component Scoped Classes**: All new components use `.cmp-*` prefix
   - `.cmp-arena`, `.cmp-dice-tray`, `.cmp-action-menu`, etc.
   - Prevents global CSS conflicts

3. **Button System Standardization**: 
   - Legacy `.btn` replaced with `.k-btn` system
   - Variants: `.k-btn--primary`, `.k-btn--secondary`, `.k-btn--warning`, `.k-btn--small`

### Legacy Usage Manifest Updates:
The `docs/legacy-usage-manifest.json` has been updated to reflect:
- All major components marked as `"status": "migrated"`
- Deprecated selectors marked with `"--removed--"` prefixes
- Clear next steps for CSS pruning phase

## Next Steps Identified

### Immediate Priority: CSS Cleanup Phase
1. **Prune Deprecated Selectors**: Remove all annotated legacy CSS blocks
2. **Add Data-Draggable Styling**: Create lightweight `[data-draggable]` utility styles
3. **Validate No Dependencies**: Ensure no remaining JavaScript logic depends on removed classes

### Visual Parity Restoration:
1. **Typography & Theme Tokens**: Reintroduce comic display fonts and accent colors
2. **Panel Chrome Parity**: Add subtle panel edge highlights and background textures  
3. **Monster Card Styling**: Extract and polish monster selection card appearance
4. **Button System Polish**: Add hover effects and neon edge styling
5. **Dark Mode Effects**: Restore soft glow effects for active elements

### Quality Assurance:
1. **Accessibility Pass**: Add focus states and ARIA labels where needed
2. **Regression Testing**: Verify all interactive elements function correctly
3. **Performance Review**: Ensure CSS bundle size reduction from legacy removal

## Key Learnings

1. **Staged Migration Approach**: The strategy of marking components as migrated while keeping legacy CSS annotated (but not deleted) allows for safe validation before final cleanup.

2. **Data Attributes vs Classes**: Using data attributes for state management (collapsed, draggable, panel type) provides cleaner separation between styling and functionality.

3. **Component Scoping**: The `.cmp-*` prefix pattern effectively prevents naming conflicts and makes it clear which styles belong to the new architecture.

4. **Visual Regression Management**: Accepting temporary visual differences during structural migration reduces complexity and allows for focused polish in later phases.

## Current State
- ✅ All major UI components migrated from legacy CSS classes
- ✅ New component-scoped CSS architecture established  
- ✅ Legacy selectors annotated for safe removal
- ⏳ Setup screen image loading issue pending resolution
- ⏳ CSS pruning phase ready to begin
- ⏳ Visual parity restoration queued for post-cleanup

The codebase is now in a stable intermediate state where all functionality is preserved through the new component architecture, and the legacy CSS can be safely removed to reduce bundle size and eliminate cascade conflicts before applying final visual theming.
