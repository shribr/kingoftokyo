# Reconstructed Collaboration Timeline (Mobile UI & Modal Modernization Focus)

Date of Reconstruction: 2025-10-03
Scope: Delta chronicle since `CHAT_HISTORY_RECONSTRUCTED_002.md`, emphasizing the iterative mobile UX adjustments (action menu, dice tray, modals), logging severity refinement, and forthcoming fullscreen modal unification + splash monster scaling. Earlier architectural foundations (store, effect queue, modifiers, phase machine) are assumed known—only new or materially evolved decisions are captured here.

> Intent: Preserve precise rationale behind rapid micro-adjust / revert cycles to avoid future ambiguity about why specific pixel, containment, or severity changes were made.

---
## 1. Context Recap (Position After _002)
From v002 baseline: core modular rewrite stable (dice → phase → effects → logging), passive modifiers live, effect queue scaffolded, UI component rails present. Focus pivoted to polishing *mobile-first* interaction cohesion before expanding feature breadth (yield UI, effect inspector, rationale overlay).

---
## 2. Mobile UX Objectives (Current Slice)
- Tighten horizontal spatial economy when the action menu expands on small screens.
- Prevent visual jitter / layout thrash when opening the action menu beside the dice tray.
- Clarify deterministic setup sequencing without alarming false-positive console errors.
- Establish a consistent strategy for large modals on mobile (fullscreen immersion, reduced chrome) prior to broad modal parity work.
- Prepare splash (monster select / presentation) for responsive scaling.

---
## 3. Implemented Changes (This Interval)
| Area | Change | Rationale | Notes |
|------|--------|-----------|-------|
| Action Menu (JS) | Increased horizontal left-shift constant to 160px when expanded on mobile | Ensures adequate space for widened interactive controls / prevents cramped dice overlap | Implemented via a single constant; applied in rAF post-layout measurement.
| Action Menu (CSS) | Enforced `min-width: 480px` for expanded state under mobile breakpoint | Earlier 460px proved marginal; 480px yields more predictable button wrapping | Media-query targeted; collapsible state keyed by `[data-collapsed='false']`.
| Dice Tray Container | Reverted prior experiment that removed (hid) `.tray-outer` wrapper on mobile | Visual containment + spacing tokens needed for consistency with other panels | Final decision: retain wrapper; avoid one-off structural divergence.
| Dice Tray Width Calc | Slight additional width reduction (subtract extra 10px) when menu expanded | Prevent edge collision with viewport after menu shift | Maintains symmetrical breathing room.
| Logging (Failsafe) | Demoted 6s setup warning from `console.error` → `console.warn` | Original severity implied a fault during expected longer cold starts | Message text unchanged for searchability.

---
## 4. Iterative / Reverted Decisions (Rationale Preserved)
| Decision Path | Final Outcome | Why Reverted / Settled |
|---------------|--------------|------------------------|
| Remove white dice tray container wrapper on mobile → hide wrapper → restore wrapper | Wrapper kept visible | Removal saved negligible vertical pixels while sacrificing consistent panel rhythm & theming extensibility.
| 460px mobile min-width for expanded action menu | Increased to 480px | Empirical check showed cramped label/icon groupings at 460px on certain card/shop states.

---
## 5. Pending / In-Progress Work
| Category | Planned Adjustment | Status | Key Considerations |
|----------|--------------------|--------|--------------------|
| Fullscreen Modals (Mobile) | Large modals (monster selection, roll-for-first, card detail, possibly yield) occupy 100vw x 100vh with simplified chrome | Not Implemented | Needs exclusion flag for "small informational" modals to avoid over-dominance.
| Roll-For-First Modal | Further reduce title font size; shrink `.rff-broadcast` padding to 2px; enforce fullscreen | Not Implemented | Maintain legibility hierarchy; ensure focus trap intact post-expansion.
| Splash / Monster Cards | Responsive scaling of monster card grid + image max-height constraints | Not Implemented | Must preserve aspect ratio; consider lazy hydration for performance.
| Modal Classification | Introduce semantic class/attribute to differentiate `modal--immersive` vs `modal--inline` | Not Implemented | Facilitates future theming + dark edition alignment.
| Documentation | This `_003` delta file | Completed | Continue append-only pattern going forward.

---
## 6. Design & Architectural Guardrails (Reaffirmed)
- Deterministic state evolution unaffected by purely visual mobile adaptations.
- No structural DOM removals that would fragment accessibility or future unified modal service.
- All new size/position logic isolated behind explicit constants or attribute-driven selectors for testability.
- Logging severity changes never alter control flow (observability layer remains side-effect free).

---
## 7. Risk / Impact Assessment
| Risk | Surface | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|---------|--------|-----------|
| Future fullscreen modal CSS collisions | Shared modal container classes | Medium | Namespaced `immersive` modifier class + conservative media queries.
| Over-expansion of action menu causing vertical clipping | Small landscape devices | Low | Add scroll fallback if intrinsic height exceeds viewport (future watch item).
| Dice tray width calc drift if additional panels introduced | Layout interplay | Low | Centralize horizontal offset constant if second shifting component added.
| Accessibility regression from fullscreen modals | Focus / scroll locking | Medium | Ensure focus trap & `aria-modal` retained; test screen reader path post-change.

---
## 8. Next Action Checklist (Short Horizon)
1. Implement mobile fullscreen modal pattern + `modal--immersive` class.  
2. Apply to monster selection & roll-for-first first (pilot).  
3. Update roll-for-first styles (title font-size decrement; `.rff-broadcast { padding:2px; }`).  
4. Introduce splash monster card responsive scaling (grid, max-height, safe tap targets).  
5. Extend pattern selectively to card detail & (upcoming) yield modal.  
6. Add automated visual/layout smoke (optional dev harness: capture bounding boxes for key components under mobile breakpoint).  

---
## 9. Implementation Notes (Forthcoming Tasks)
- Fullscreen modal CSS prototype:
  - `@media (max-width: 760px) { .modal.modal--immersive { position:fixed; inset:0; width:100vw; height:100vh; border-radius:0; } }`
  - Provide internal scroll region: `.modal--immersive .modal-content { overflow:auto; -webkit-overflow-scrolling:touch; }`
- Title scaling: Add clamp utility or direct override (e.g., `font-size: clamp(1rem, 3.8vw, 1.25rem);`).
- Broadcast padding: Direct override under narrow breakpoint; maintain min touch target for interactive elements inside.
- Splash scaling: Use CSS grid `auto-fit / minmax()` strategy plus `aspect-ratio` (if feasible) or fallback `object-fit: contain` wrapper.

---
## 10. Validation Approach (Post-Change)
| Aspect | Quick Test | Expected Result |
|--------|-----------|----------------|
| Action Menu Open on Mobile | Expand & measure left shift | Stable 160px shift; no jitter after animation frame.
| Dice Tray Integrity | Open menu + interact with dice | No overlap; width respects offset margin.
| Fullscreen Modal Pilot | Open monster selection on narrow viewport | Edge-to-edge frame; scroll within content only.
| Roll-for-First Broadcast | Inspect padding | Exactly 2px inner padding; no text clipping.
| Logging | Observe setup >6s scenario | Warning (not error) entry with unchanged message text.

## 11. Append-Only Update Protocol
For each future micro-cycle, append a new heading:
```
### Update YYYY-MM-DD
- Added ...
- Changed ...
- Reverted ...
- Pending ...
```
Avoid historical rewrites—preserve decision trail for forensic / parity audits.

## 12. Summary Snapshot (Current State Keywords)
`mobileShift=160px` · `actionMenuMinWidth=480px` · `failsafeSeverity=warn` · `fullscreenModals=pending` · `rffBroadcastPaddingTarget=2px` · `splashScaling=pending`
