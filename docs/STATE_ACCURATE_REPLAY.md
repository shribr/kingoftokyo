# State-Accurate Replay Implementation Summary

## âœ… Completed Features

### 1. Game State Snapshot Service (`gameStateSnapshot.js`)
- **Captures complete game state** including players, dice, Tokyo occupancy, cards, phase, and effects
- **Validates state snapshots** with comprehensive error checking and warnings
- **Restores game state** by dispatching `GAME_STATE_IMPORTED` action to Redux store
- **Creates state diffs** for debugging and verification
- **Lightweight capture** for performance optimization

### 2. Enhanced Auto-Archive System
- **State capture integration** - captures final game state at game over
- **Dual archive support** - both game logs and AIDT logs include state snapshots
- **Retention management** - automatic cleanup based on settings
- **Storage optimization** - JSON payloads with `stateSnapshot` field

### 3. Advanced Replay Service (`replayService.js`)
- **State hydration** - restores captured state before replay begins
- **Event-driven architecture** - emits specific events for UI synchronization
- **Graceful fallback** - falls back to log-only replay if state invalid
- **Enhanced progress tracking** - detailed progress and status information
- **Performance optimized** - configurable replay speed and background processing

### 4. Visual State Overlay (`replayStateOverlay.js`)
- **Real-time state display** - shows dice, Tokyo status, player stats, current phase
- **Progress tracking** - visual progress bar with entry count and percentage
- **Interactive controls** - pause/resume/stop with integrated status updates
- **Event synchronization** - listens to replay events for live state updates
- **Responsive design** - adapts to different screen sizes

### 5. Enhanced Game Log Viewer
- **Integrated overlay** - seamlessly integrates state overlay with existing controls
- **Auto-cleanup** - proper event listener management and resource cleanup
- **Status feedback** - clear indicators for state restoration success/failure
- **Enhanced controls** - improved replay controls with better status tracking

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### State Capture Process
1. **Game Over Detection** - `turnService.js` detects winner via auto-archive hook
2. **State Snapshot** - `gameStateSnapshot.captureGameState()` creates complete state copy
3. **Archive Creation** - `autoArchiveTempService.autoArchiveOnGameOver()` stores log + state
4. **Storage** - localStorage with timestamped keys and JSON payloads

### Replay Process
1. **Archive Selection** - User selects archived game from log viewer
2. **State Validation** - `validateStateSnapshot()` checks compatibility
3. **State Restoration** - `restoreGameState()` dispatches state to Redux store
4. **Visual Setup** - Replay overlay displays initial game state
5. **Log Playback** - Sequential processing of log entries with state synchronization
6. **Event Emission** - Specific events trigger overlay updates and animations

### Event Architecture
- `replay.started` - Replay begins, overlay initialized
- `replay.entry` - Each log entry processed, progress updated
- `replay.phaseChange` - Game phase transitions
- `replay.vpChange` - Victory point changes
- `replay.tokyoChange` - Tokyo occupancy changes
- `replay.diceRoll` - Dice roll events
- `replay.energyChange` - Energy modifications
- `replay.healthChange` - Health/damage events
- `replay.ended` - Replay complete, cleanup triggered

## ðŸ§ª Testing Instructions

### Manual Testing Workflow

#### 1. Setup Test Game
```bash
# Enable auto-archive in settings
# Set retention to 7 days, max 10 logs
# Start a new game with 2+ players
```

#### 2. Generate Test Data
```bash
# Play through several turns including:
# - Dice rolling and keeping
# - Energy/VP gains
# - Tokyo entry/exit
# - Health changes/damage
# - Power card purchases
# - Game completion (via VP or elimination)
```

#### 3. Verify Auto-Archive
```bash
# Check settings menu â†’ Advanced â†’ View Game Logs
# Verify archived game appears with timestamp
# Confirm both game and AIDT logs are created
# Verify state snapshot is included in archive data
```

#### 4. Test State-Accurate Replay
```bash
# Open archived game log
# Click "Start Game Replay"
# Verify:
#   - Replay overlay appears
#   - Initial state is accurately restored
#   - Progress bar updates correctly
#   - Player stats, Tokyo status, dice faces display correctly
#   - Visual animations occur during state changes
#   - Pause/resume/stop controls work
#   - Event synchronization is accurate
```

#### 5. Test Fallback Scenarios
```bash
# Test log-only replay (manually remove stateSnapshot from archive)
# Test invalid state snapshot (corrupt JSON)
# Test version compatibility (future state format changes)
```

### Validation Checkpoints

#### State Accuracy
- [ ] Player stats (health, energy, VP) match original game
- [ ] Tokyo occupancy (City/Bay) correctly restored
- [ ] Dice faces and results display accurately
- [ ] Game phase and active player indicated correctly
- [ ] Visual state updates synchronized with log entries

#### User Experience
- [ ] Overlay positioning doesn't obstruct main game UI
- [ ] Controls are responsive and intuitive
- [ ] Progress tracking is clear and accurate
- [ ] Auto-cleanup prevents resource leaks
- [ ] Error states are handled gracefully

#### Performance
- [ ] Large log files replay smoothly
- [ ] State restoration is fast (< 1 second)
- [ ] Memory usage remains stable during replay
- [ ] UI remains responsive during playback

## ðŸ“‹ Known Limitations

1. **State Compatibility** - Future Redux state changes may break older snapshots
2. **Storage Size** - Complete state snapshots increase archive size
3. **Visual Fidelity** - Some animations/effects may not replay exactly
4. **Performance** - Very large games (100+ entries) may have slower replay

## ðŸ”„ Future Enhancements

1. **Replay Speed Control** - Variable playback speed (0.5x, 2x, etc.)
2. **Timeline Scrubbing** - Jump to specific points in replay
3. **State Comparison** - Diff view between original and replayed state
4. **Export Options** - Export replay as video or shareable format
5. **Deterministic Verification** - Automated testing of replay accuracy
