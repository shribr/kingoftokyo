### Legacy CSS
`/css/components.card-modals.css` contains old `.player-cards-modal` selectors that may be for a different, older modal system. Left unchanged as it doesn't conflict with the new component.

## Verification

### Component Structure
```
/src/components/player-power-cards-modal/
  └── player-power-cards-modal.component.js
```

### CSS
```
/css/components.player-power-cards-modal.css
```

### Config Entries
- **playerPowerCardsModal** registered in components.config.json
- Build/update functions: `player-power-cards-modal.build` / `player-power-cards-modal.update`
- Selector: `.cmp-player-power-cards-modal`

## Purpose of Rename
The new name `player-power-cards-modal` is more specific than `player-cards-modal` because:
1. **Clarity**: Immediately clear that it displays power cards (not victory points, stars, or other "cards")
2. **Consistency**: Matches naming pattern of power card related features
3. **Maintainability**: Future developers can easily distinguish this from other card-related modals
