## Deterministic Mode (NEW SECTION)
**Purpose**: Ensure reproducible AI decision outcomes for CI & regression analysis.

**Activation**: `window.__KOT_TEST_MODE__ = true` (or ENV flag at build time)

**Behavior Changes**:
1. Monte Carlo trial count fixed (e.g., 80 trials) instead of adaptive.
2. Seeded RNG (Mulberry32 or similar) keyed by `turnCycleId` + roll number.
3. Decision output includes `meta: { seed, trials }` for audit.
4. Performance profiling disabled (avoids adaptive feedback loops).

**Test Harness Expectations**:
- Snapshot tests assert identical `keepIndices`, `stopEarly`, `confidence`, and `factors` arrays across N runs.
- Divergence triggers diagnostic dump (state view + RNG seed).

---

## Concurrency Guard Pattern (NEW SECTION)
**Purpose**: Prevent stale asynchronous callbacks (effects, timers, delayed UI pacing) from mutating state after a new turn begins.

**Core Mechanism**:
1. A monotonically increasing `turnCycleId` increments on each `NEXT_TURN` (or equivalent state transition).
2. Async producers capture a snapshot (`const cycle = getTurnCycleId()`) when scheduling work.
3. Before executing, guarded callbacks compare current `turnCycleId` to the captured snapshot; if mismatched, they abort silently.
4. Utilities supplied in `turnGuards.js`:
	- `makeTurnGuard(getCycleFn)` ‚Üí returns `{ isStale(snapshot), snapshot() }` helpers.
	- `guardedTimeout(store, fn, ms, label?)` ‚Üí wraps `setTimeout`, executing only if cycle unchanged.

**Design Goals**:
- Eliminate race conditions from overlapping phase transitions.
- Ensure effect queue cannot apply outdated effects post-yield / elimination.
- Provide low-friction migration path (drop-in replacement for `setTimeout`).
- Maintain deterministic test mode stability (aborted callbacks do not perturb RNG sequence).

**Current Coverage (Oct 1, 2025)**:
- Effect engine processing loop (stale cycle abort)
- Dice roll resolution path (event driven; no lingering polling)
- Selection polling inside effect engine (converted to `guardedTimeout`)

**Pending Coverage**:
- Animation pacing timers (enter/leave Tokyo visuals)
- Yield modal auto-dismiss / CPU pacing timers
- Card purchase debounce / advisory timers
- Any residual legacy `setTimeout` usages (audit pass required)

**Migration Checklist** (for each `setTimeout` found):
1. Replace with `guardedTimeout(store, () => { /* original body */ }, delay, 'label')`.
2. If callback chains further async work, ensure each link re-validates or uses guarded wrappers.
3. Add optional dev log on stale abort when `TEST_MODE` to surface unexpected drops.

**Instrumentation Roadmap**:
- Introduce optional dev overlay panel row: Guard Drops (count per turn).
- Emit telemetry event `guard.abort` with `{ label, scheduledAt, executedAt? }` (executedAt absent when aborted).

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- No state mutations observed from callbacks whose scheduling turn != execution turn in 500-turn simulation.
- Guarded Timer Coverage metric ‚â•95%.
- Zero phase FSM violations attributable to stale async side-effects.

**Next Actions**:
1. Audit remaining timeouts ‚Üí produce coverage report.
2. Wrap high-frequency pacing timers first (yield decision, animation sequences).
3. Add harness to simulate rapid consecutive `NEXT_TURN` events and verify zero stale mutations.

## Phase Finite State Machine (NEW SECTION)
**Status**: Prototype integrated (`phaseMachine.js`) behind feature flag `window.__KOT_FLAGS__.USE_PHASE_MACHINE`.

**Phases**: SETUP ‚Üí ROLL ‚Üí RESOLVE ‚Üí (YIELD_DECISION | BUY | GAME_OVER) ‚Üí BUY ‚Üí (BUY_WAIT) ‚Üí CLEANUP ‚Üí ROLL ‚Ä¶

**Transition Guard Hooks** (context-driven):
- diceSequenceComplete: dice sub-phase reached resolved/sequence-complete
- yieldRequired: yield prompts exist (Tokyo attack)
- resolutionComplete: dice accepted, no unresolved yield prompts, effect queue idle (strengthened Oct 1 2025)
- victoryConditionMet: winner flagged in meta slice
- yieldDecisionsResolved: all yield prompts decided
- postPurchaseFollowupsPending: effect queue has pending follow-ups
- postPurchaseDone: queue drained & idle
- buyWindowClosed: pacing window elapsed or user confirmed
- turnAdvanceReady: cleanup complete / safe to advance

**Actions/Events**: PHASE_TRANSITION (meta logged), PHASE_TRANSITION_INVALID (telemetry)

**Reducer**: `phaseTransitionReducer` holds current, previous, history (cap 100).

**Invalid Transition Telemetry**: increments `window.__KOT_PHASE_WARN__` and appends event to optional `window.__KOT_TELEMETRY__`.

**Adoption Plan**:
1. Run with flag off (default) & compare logs for parity (ROLL/RESOLVE/BUY/CLEANUP sequence) ‚Äì harness supports.
2. Enable flag in dev to detect illegal legacy direct dispatches (search for `phaseChanged(` occurrences to replace).
3. Expand guards (e.g., forbid RESOLVE‚ÜíBUY unless dice.accepted=true and effectQueue pending=0 unless buy path).
4. Integrate min-duration enforcement (DONE prototype: ROLL‚â•300ms, RESOLVE‚â•180ms, BUY‚â•350ms) ‚Äì transition defers if not elapsed.

**Next Enhancements**:
- Replace direct phaseChanged dispatch calls globally (lint rule or runtime warn).
- Add explicit reason codes enumeration to avoid free-form strings.
- Integrate with deterministic mode snapshots for phase history diffs.
- Add assertion harness: ensure no duplicate PHASE_TRANSITION with identical from/to consecutively.
- Adaptive min durations based on CPU speed setting (e.g., fast lowers thresholds but never 0).

**Acceptance Criteria (FSM)**:
- 0 invalid transitions across 500 simulated turns (test harness) with phase machine enabled.
- Phase history aligns with legacy baseline trace for equivalent scenarios.
- Telemetry includes reason + turnCycleId for each PHASE_TRANSITION entry.
