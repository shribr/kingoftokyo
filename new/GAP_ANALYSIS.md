3. **AI Decision Intelligence** - Lacks strategic planning
4. **Shop Interface Polish** - Basic functionality only
5. **Game Save/Load** - Limited persistence

### Medium Priority (Limits experience)
1. **Advanced Animations** - Minimal visual feedback
2. **Sound System** - Not implemented
3. **Accessibility Features** - Partial implementation
4. **Error Handling** - Basic error management
5. **Performance Optimization** - Not optimized

### Low Priority (Nice to have)
1. **Game Statistics** - Not implemented
2. **Multiple Game Modes** - Only classic mode
3. **Customization Options** - Limited settings
4. **Advanced Logging** - Basic logging only

## üéØ **Corrected Completion Estimate**

Based on actual implementation analysis:

**New System Overall: ~25% Complete**
- Architecture: 90% ‚úÖ
- Core Logic: 30% ‚ö†Ô∏è  
- UI Components: 25% ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Game Features: 20% ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Polish & Testing: 10% ‚ùå

**Key Insight**: The documentation significantly overestimated completion. The new system has excellent architectural foundations but lacks the game logic depth and UI polish needed for a complete game.

## üìã **Recommended Implementation Roadmap**

### Phase 1: Core Gameplay (8-10 weeks)
1. **Complete Power Card System**
   - Expand card catalog to 30+ cards
   - Implement complex effect engine
   - Add card interaction system

2. **Enhanced AI System**
   - Port strategic decision making
   - Implement personality-based behavior
   - Add multi-turn planning

3. **Polish Game Flow**
   - Improve animations and feedback
   - Complete modal system
   - Fix edge cases and bugs

### Phase 2: User Experience (4-6 weeks)
1. **UI Polish & Theming**
   - Complete visual parity
   - Add accessibility features
   - Implement sound system

2. **Advanced Features**
   - Complete save/load system
   - Add game statistics
   - Implement settings system

### Phase 3: Testing & Launch (2-4 weeks)
1. **Testing & Quality Assurance**
   - Complete test coverage
   - Performance optimization
   - Bug fixes and polish

2. **Documentation & Deployment**
   - Update documentation
   - Deployment preparation
   - User testing and feedback

## üîç **Conclusion**

The new system shows **excellent architectural promise** but requires **significant development** to reach the claimed completion levels. The modular architecture and clean separation of concerns provide a solid foundation for rapid development, but substantial work remains to implement the full game experience.

The legacy system remains the **only fully playable version** and should be maintained until the new system reaches feature parity.

**Realistic Timeline**: 3-6 months of focused development to reach 90% completion and production readiness.

## üìà Parity Progress Delta (Addendum ‚Äì September 29, 2025)
This addendum updates the assessment since the December 30, 2024 snapshot.

### Notable Improvements Achieved (Dec 2024 ‚Üí Sept 2025)
| Area | Prior State | Current State | Notes |
|------|-------------|--------------|-------|
| Tokyo Dual-Slot Logic | Absent | Implemented (City + Bay) | Includes start-of-turn VP differentiation |
| Start-of-Turn VP Logic | Simplified | Correct City (2) / Bay (1) | Logging present; needs tests |
| Shop Flush Mechanic | Missing | Implemented (2‚ö°) | Logging & tests pending |
| Peek / Deck Intel | Missing | Added (Clairvoyance card) | Non-core enhancement; optional |
| Dice Slot Expansion Rendering | Static | Dynamic + animation | Needs stacking tests |
| Attack Visual Feedback | Basic shake | Added pulse overlay | Extend with batching metrics |
| Yield Prompt Scaffold | Not started | Basic heuristic + timeout prompts | Requires unification & UX parity |
| Effect Queue | Concept only | Scaffold (no processor UI) | Needs operationalization |
| Pause / Resume | Legacy only | Added slice + overlay | Timing still bypasses FSM (planned) |

### Recast Composite Parity
Earlier internal doc overstated rewrite parity (~95%) by counting raw mechanic presence. Recomputed experiential parity ‚âà 50% (see `RULES_PARITY.md`, `docs/GAME_FLOW_PARITY_AUDIT.md`, and revised `docs/DEVELOPMENT_SUMMARY.md`).

### Outstanding High-Risk Gaps (Unchanged or Emerging)
- No finite state machine ‚Üí timing races.  
- AI strategy shallow (no multi-turn EV, no personality differentials).  
- Yield interaction clarity below legacy (mixed auto + timeout).  
- Effect engine inert beyond simple immediate card effects.  
- Persistence absent (cannot resume long games).  

### Updated Critical Path (Next 4 Weeks)
1. Phase FSM + `turnCycleId` concurrency guard.  
2. Event-driven dice completion (`DICE_ROLL_RESOLVED`), remove CPU polling loop.  
3. Unified yield modal + deterministic AI decision pipeline.  
4. BUY_WAIT explicit phase; remove arbitrary delay.  
5. Timing instrumentation & span logging (foundation for regression metrics).  
6. Baseline persistence (serialize core slices; version header).  
7. AI heuristic expansion (survival risk, VP race, resource economy, Tokyo risk).  

### Success Metrics to Re-Evaluate After Above
| Metric | Target | Current | Collection Method |
|--------|--------|---------|-------------------|
| CPU Turn Duration Consistency | œÉ/Œº < 0.25 | ~0.55 (est) | Timing spans | 
| Yield Decision Latency (AI) | < 300ms | 0‚Äì5100ms (timeout variance) | Prompt timestamps |
| Phase Transition Violations | 0 per 100 turns | Not tracked | FSM asserts |
| Stale Async Actions | 0 | Not tracked | turnCycleId invalidations |

### Documentation Adjustment Policy
All parity claim changes must include:  
1. Mechanical diff summary  
2. Experiential metrics snapshot  
3. Open regression risks

## üìà Addendum ‚Äì Verified Status After Code Scan (Sept 30, 2025)

This supplemental addendum reconciles prior parity assertions with the actual code now present under `new/src/` as of Sept 30, 2025.

### AI System Reality
- Canonical advanced engine: `src/ai/engine/AIDecisionEngine.js` (branch simulation, Monte Carlo EV, portfolio optimizer, projection object).
- Duplicate historical file: `new/js/ai-decisions.js` (should be deprecated to avoid drift).
- Split application paths:
   - `cpuTurnController.js` invokes engine immediately per roll (authoritative path for CPU turns).
   - `aiDecisionService.js` still schedules auto-keeps (timer) and enriches decision tree ‚Üí dual path risk.
- Purchase logic uses a simplistic efficiency heuristic; does not exploit portfolio optimizer scoring output.
- Yield evaluation is a basic helper (`evaluateYieldDecision`) not integrated with the engine‚Äôs projection metrics.

### Effect Engine Reality
- Effect queue scaffold (`effectQueue.reducer.js`, `effectEngine.js`) supports atomic effects: `vp_gain`, `energy_gain`, `heal_all`, `dice_slot`, `reroll_bonus`.
- No targeted effect pause / interactive choice UI yet.
- No queue visualization panel; no failure / retry semantics.
- Passive modifiers (diceSlots, rerollBonus) applied, but reducers read via global (`window.__KOT_NEW__`) ‚Üí purity + determinism concern.

### Recalibrated Rewrite Completion (Focused Dimensions)
| Dimension | Earlier Claim | Verified | Notes |
|-----------|---------------|----------|-------|
| AI Roll / Keep Depth | 60‚Äì70% | ~70% | Logic ahead of legacy in depth; integration fragmented |
| AI Purchase Strategy | ~40% | ~25% | Portfolio optimizer unused in actuation |
| Yield Decision Parity | ~40% | ~30% | Projection data not driving yield heuristics |
| Effect Processing Depth | ~45% | ~35% | Only simple immediate effects; no chaining or prompts |
| UI Gameplay Panel Parity | ~60% | ~55% | Missing effect queue & refined yield modal |
| Documentation Accuracy | ~70% | ~60% | Several docs describe unshipped features (market rarity logic, full decision tree)

### Newly Identified Gaps
1. Dual AI actuation pathways (timer vs controller) can produce race conditions.
2. Global store peeks in reducers (modifier access) undermine test determinism.
3. Monte Carlo adaptivity introduces non-deterministic variance (no TEST_MODE guard).
4. Effect queue unaware of pending deltas for AI perception (e.g. heals about to apply).
5. Decision tree mixes heterogeneous node provenance (raw heuristic + enriched engine) without labeling.

### Immediate Corrective Priorities (Supplemental)
A. Deprecate & remove duplicate AI file; retain single engine import path.
B. Deterministic mode (fixed trial count + seeded RNG) for reproducible tests.
C. Introduce perception layer (`buildAIState`) to eliminate global window usage.
D. Unify decision actuation (remove auto-keep timer logic from `aiDecisionService`).
E. Add minimal effect queue UI + instrumentation events (enqueue/start/resolve/fail).
F. Replace purchase heuristic with portfolio optimizer advisory output.

### Success Criteria Additions
- Single engine module import across codebase (lint rule or CI grep check).
- Deterministic snapshot tests pass 10 consecutive runs with identical JSON outputs.
- Effect queue transitions produce structured log lines: `effect:<id>:<status>`.
- No reducer references `window.__KOT_NEW__` for AI-related data.
- Yield advisory object includes: `{ decision: 'stay'|'leave', hpRisk, vpRaceDelta, confidence }` and drives actuation.

### Metrics to Track (New)
| Metric | Target | Rationale |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Dual Engine Invocations / Roll | 0 | Ensures unified pipeline |
| Deterministic Decision Variance | 0 diffs / 10 runs | CI stability |
| Modifier Access Purity | 100% selector-based | Test isolation |
| Effect-Aware Decisions (when queue pending) | ‚â•90% annotated | Demonstrates perception enrichment |
