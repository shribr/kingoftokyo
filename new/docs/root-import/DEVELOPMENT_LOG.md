# King of Tokyo Web Game - Development Log

## Overview
This document provides a comprehensive technical chronicle of the King of Tokyo web game development from September 8-17, 2025. It details the specific implementations, git commits, code changes, and technical architecture decisions made throughout the 10-day development journey.

### Update (Sept 30, 2025) - Chat Persistence Tooling Added
Introduced a dual-layer persistence system after accidental loss of ephemeral workspace chat threads:
1. File-based transcripts: `logs/chat/YYYY-MM-DD.md` (and optional `--session` variants) appended via `node new/tools/chatLogger.js` or `npm run log:chat -- --role user --content "..."`.
2. Browser localStorage module: `js/chat-persistence.js` exposing `ChatPersistence` API (`addMessage`, `exportMarkdown`, `downloadMarkdown`, etc.) for in-browser capture and manual export.

Rationale: Prevent recurrence of irreversible loss from VS Code "Clear All Workspace Chats" action; ensure architectural and reasoning discussions are durably archived.

Future Enhancements (Planned): Daily summarizer script, optional redact filter for sensitive tokens, integration with development session start/stop hooks.

### Day 13: September 24, 2025 - Phase 10 Completion (Transparency, Projection, Accessibility)
#### Post Day 13 Enhancement (Sept 30, 2025): Accept Dice Results Action
Implemented an optional mid-roll flow allowing players to apply dice effects (energy gain, healing, VP from triples, claw damage) prior to formally ending the roll phase. This enables purchasing power cards with newly gained energy before advancing the turn.

Technical Details:
- Added `DICE_RESULTS_ACCEPTED` action & `diceResultsAccepted()` creator.
- Extended `diceReducer` with `accepted` flag (idempotent; resets on new turn).
- Added `acceptDiceResults()` method to `turnService` invoking `resolveDice(store, logger)` without advancing global phase.
- Inserted new button in action menu: `ACCEPT DICE RESULTS` (disabled for CPU, enabled when dice are resolved and not yet accepted).
- UI logic disables Roll / Keep All after acceptance and updates button label to `DICE ACCEPTED`.
- Ensures phase progression remains player-driven—player still presses End Turn to transition to RESOLVE/BUY sequence.
- Refreshed card affordability post-accept via `ui/cards/refreshAffordability` event.

Safeguards & Idempotency:
- Multiple clicks on Accept are ignored (flag guards second invocation).
- Rerolls prohibited after acceptance (roll button disabled condition updated).
- Does not mutate phase; existing end-turn path (resolve -> buy) remains compatible.

Follow-Up Considerations:
- Potential UI highlight or toast confirming effects applied.
- Possible automatic phase hint (e.g., glow on End Turn) once accepted.
- Audit interaction with yield prompts (currently unchanged; accept is pre-phase-change only).

##### Refinement (Sept 30, 2025 - Later)
- Added enable gating to Accept button: requires at least one kept die; disabled on final roll (auto-accept triggers internally).
- Auto-apply dice effects immediately when rerolls reach zero (no manual Accept needed).
- Prevent double application in `resolve()` if already accepted.
- Removed dev overlay label "Phase Timings" per UI clarity request (panel content now minimal).

**Context**: Final sweep to complete all remaining Phase 10 objectives: portfolio-aware scoring, multi-roll projection, richer transparency UI, and baseline accessibility instrumentation.

###### Visual Enhancement (Sept 30, 2025 - Later) - Tokyo Entry Animation
Added a non-blocking visual Tokyo entry animation in the enhanced UI (`new/` code path). When a player first occupies Tokyo City or Bay after dice acceptance / resolution, their active profile card now:
1. Clones itself into a floating element positioned over the active slot
2. Animates (translate + scale) toward the Tokyo City or Bay anchor (or arena fallback)
3. Fades slightly while traveling (750ms flight)
4. Restores the original card into the monsters panel with `data-in-tokyo="true"`

Technical Implementation:
- New service: `new/src/services/tokyoEntryAnimationService.js` bound during bootstrap.
- Detects occupant changes by diffing `tokyo.cityOccupant` / `tokyo.bayOccupant` against previous values.
- Guards overlapping animations with `animating` flag; exits silently on errors (degrades gracefully for tests / SSR).
- Phase gating: only animates during early post-resolution phases (`RESOLVE`, `BUY`, `YIELD_DECISION`) to avoid mid-turn confusion.
- Uses clone node (fixed positioning) to prevent layout jitter in original containers.
- Applies attributes for future styling or analytics: `data-in-tokyo`, `data-tokyo-animated-at`.

Future Extension Targets:
- Exit animation (reverse flight back out of Tokyo).
- Prefers-reduced-motion compliance (skip or shorten animation).
- CSS class-based styling (current version inlines primary transition—scheduled for refactor to shared stylesheet with damage highlight effects).

###### Addendum (Sept 30, 2025 - Enhancements Implemented)
- Added dedicated anchor elements in arena markup: `<span data-tokyo-city-anchor>` and `<span data-tokyo-bay-anchor>` for precise flight targeting.
- Implemented prefers-reduced-motion support (short 120ms translation, no scale compression) for both entry and exit flights.
- Added exit animation (Tokyo departure) mirroring entry path; card returns to panel with timestamp attribute.
- Introduced damage highlight pulse on health loss via `data-damage-flash` and keyframes `kot-damage-pulse`.
- Created `components.player-animations.css` consolidating flight transitions, damage pulse, anchor glow, and entry glow overlay.
- Added anchor glow burst on entry and card radial glow overlay (`data-entry-glow`).
- Implemented lightweight animation queue (FIFO) so simultaneous Tokyo entry/exit events serialize without visual overlap.


#### Portfolio-Aware Dice Scoring
**File Modified**: `js/ai-decisions.js`  
`_scoreDice` now amplifies energy face valuation when the optimized target portfolio (via `optimizePowerCardPortfolio`) identifies missing desired feature tags and the shop holds matching cards. Adds a bias toward generating energy when acquisition probability this turn meaningfully advances strategic gaps (extra reroll, extra die, survivability, damage scaling).

#### Depth-2 Lightweight Projection
**Addition**: `_projectTwoRollEV(state, keepIndices)` engaged when rolls remain > 0. Performs limited Monte Carlo-like trials (default 60) to estimate:
* `tripleChance` – probability of securing at least one triple across current kept + projected rerolls.
* `avgAttack`, `avgEnergy`, `avgHeal` – mean yield contributions factoring prospective rerolls.  
Result object attached to final decision (`decision.projection`) and surfaced in transparency UI.

#### Expanded Branch Transparency
**UI Changes** (`js/main.js`): Decision tree modal now lists top 8 considered branches (tag, improvement EV, special utility, combined score). Includes a concise best-branch summary and a projection panel enumerating multi-roll metrics.

#### Accessibility Instrumentation
**Markup** (`index.html`): Added `role="dialog"`, `aria-modal="true"`, and `aria-labelledby` on all modals (settings, decision tree, game log, instructions, storage, profiles, exit confirm, setup, game over). Each modal heading assigned an id for label association.  
**Utilities**: Existing `UIUtilities.trapFocus` applied on modal open pathways (`showSettings`, `showGameLog`, `showAIDecisionTree`). Announcements triggered (`announcePhase`) to live regions for context shift feedback.  
**Styling**: Removed inline display style from roll-off button; introduced `css/rolloff.css` with `.rolloff-hidden` class.

#### Decision Object Enhancements
`decision.branchAnalysis.considered` expanded to top 8 for fuller context. `decision.projection` adds forward-looking metrics. Logging/visualization updated to surface these without altering existing consumer contracts.

#### Performance & Safeguards
Maintained branch evaluation cap (≤25). Projection trial count (60) chosen to balance variance reduction with latency; future tuning slated for Phase 11 profiling. Portfolio optimization reused per decision path without additional memoization (candidate for caching if profiling indicates cost hotspots).

#### Validation
Post-change error scans: No syntax errors. Manual quick run (dice phase) confirms decision tree modal renders new tables (visual QA pending style refinement). ARIA attributes pass basic inspection (unique `aria-labelledby` targets present).

#### Phase 10 Status: COMPLETE
All originally scoped and subsequently added transparency & heuristic depth items delivered:
1. Branch EV simulation & alternative branch listing.
2. Portfolio-integrated energy urgency.
3. Depth-2 projection metrics.
4. Accessible modals (roles, labels, focus trapping, announcements).
5. Richer decision tree visualization (branches + projection).
6. Inline styling cleanup for compliance baseline.

#### Next (Phase 11 Preview)
1. Performance Profiling: Measure average AI decision latency; adaptive scaling of projection trials.
2. Correctness Tests: Unit-style harness for `_projectTwoRollEV` stability (seeded RNG) & branch ranking invariants.
3. Caching/Memoization: Potentially cache portfolio optimization per turn.
4. Documentation: Update `DEVELOPMENT_SUMMARY.md` with Phase 10 closure summary and projection metric definitions.
5. UI Polish: Table styling, responsive layout adjustments, optional collapse/expand for branch detail.

## Major Bug Fixes & Technical Solutions

### 1. Power Cards Modal Close Button Fix
**Technical Problem**: Modal lacked functional close button, trapping users
**Git Commit**: Part of larger UI improvements
**Files Modified**: `js/main.js`, `css/modals.css`

**Technical Solution**:
**Problem**: The power cards modal lacked a functional close button, trapping users in the modal.
**Solution**: 
- Integrated UIUtilities.safeAddEventListener for robust event handling
- Added proper modal close functionality with consistent UX patterns
- Ensured event handlers were properly managed to prevent memory leaks

### 2. Comprehensive Player Elimination System
**Problem**: When players were eliminated, the game didn't handle Tokyo occupancy properly, leaving empty Tokyo zones or unclear attacker replacement logic.
**Solution**:
- Implemented complete elimination workflow with immediate Tokyo clearing
- Added attacker replacement logic when Tokyo occupants are eliminated
- Created dramatic elimination dialog with dark red/black theme and glowing text effects
- Enhanced monsters.js with detailed damage result reporting
- Added comprehensive UI state management for eliminated players

### 3. "Friend of Children" Power Card Duplicate Points Bug
**Problem**: The "Friend of Children" card was awarding 3 victory points per turn instead of 1, breaking game balance.
**Root Cause**: Turn-based effects were being processed in three different locations:
- `applyPassiveCardEffects()` during dice resolution (incorrect)
- `endTurn()` method at turn end (incorrect) 
- `applyStartOfTurnEffects()` at turn start (correct)

**Solution**:
- Added turn-based effect deduplication tracking system (`turnEffectsApplied` Map)
- Removed turn effects from passive card effects (should only trigger on dice-related events)
- Removed turn effects from end-of-turn processing (should be start-of-turn only)
- Implemented proper effect tracking with `clearTurnEffects()`, `hasTurnEffectBeenApplied()`, and `markTurnEffectApplied()`

### 4. "Extra Head" Power Card Dice System Fix
**Problem**: The "Extra Head" card wasn't giving players an extra die. The game has 8 total dice (6 active + 2 disabled) but the card wasn't enabling the disabled dice correctly.
**Root Cause**: Game logic was using `addExtraDie()` which creates new dice instead of enabling existing disabled dice.

**Solution**:
- Fixed dice activation to use `enableExtraDie()` on existing disabled dice (indices 6-7)
- Added player-specific tracking with `extraDiceEnabled` property
- Implemented turn-based cleanup to disable extra dice when turn ends
- Added UI updates with `diceUpdated` events to show/hide extra dice in real-time
- Ensured extra dice are only active during the card owner's turn

### 5. Game Over Dialog Improvements
**Problem**: Game over dialog had player cards visible on top and no way to close/exit to splash screen.
**Solution**:
- Added high z-index (999999) to ensure modal appears above all player cards
- Added close button (×) in top-right corner with proper 15px padding
- Implemented `closeGameOverModal()` method that properly cleans up game state
- Added safe event handling and return-to-splash functionality

## Human-AI Collaboration Strategies

### Visual Communication Breakthrough
**Screenshots as Context**: The most effective collaboration tool was the human providing screenshots of actual game issues. When the human shared the game over dialog screenshot showing the overlapping player card, the AI immediately understood both the visual problem and the required UX solution. This visual context was far more effective than lengthy text descriptions.

### Iterative Debugging Approach
1. **Problem Identification**: Human identifies issue through gameplay
2. **Code Exploration**: AI uses grep_search and read_file tools to understand current implementation
3. **Root Cause Analysis**: AI traces through multiple code paths to find the actual source
4. **Targeted Fix**: AI implements specific, minimal changes rather than broad rewrites
5. **Testing Validation**: Human tests fix and provides feedback

### Context Management Strategies
**File Reading Patterns**: AI learned to read larger meaningful chunks rather than consecutive small sections to minimize tool calls and maintain better context understanding.

**Cross-File Understanding**: Complex bugs (like "Friend of Children") required understanding relationships between:
- `cards.js` (effect definitions)
- `game.js` (effect processing logic)  
- `monsters.js` (player state management)
- `main.js` (UI coordination)

### Communication Patterns That Worked

#### Effective Human Communication:
- **Specific Problem Description**: "extra head power card is not giving the player an extra die"
- **Expected Behavior Clarification**: "there are 8 dice total. only 6 are active unless a player has the 'extra head' power card"
- **Visual Evidence**: Screenshots showing actual vs expected behavior
- **Context Continuation**: "Continue: 'Continue to iterate?'" when AI assistance was needed

#### Effective AI Responses:
- **Comprehensive Summaries**: AI provided detailed technical summaries after each fix
- **Root Cause Analysis**: AI traced bugs to their actual source rather than treating symptoms
- **Implementation Details**: AI documented both the problem and the complete solution
- **Code Context Preservation**: AI maintained understanding of previous fixes while working on new issues

### Technical Debugging Insights

#### Turn-Based Effect Systems
The "Friend of Children" bug revealed the complexity of turn-based effect systems in games. The issue wasn't in the card definition but in the game's effect processing pipeline having multiple trigger points. This required:
- Understanding the complete game turn lifecycle
- Identifying all locations where effects are processed
- Implementing deduplication mechanisms

#### UI State Management
The elimination system highlighted the importance of coordinated UI updates across multiple components:
- Modal dialogs for dramatic feedback
- Player card state updates
- Tokyo occupancy visual indicators
- Game log coordination

#### Event-Driven Architecture
Multiple fixes relied on proper event handling patterns:
- UIUtilities for safe event listener management
- Modal show/hide coordination
- Dice update event triggering for real-time UI updates

## Collaboration Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge: Context Loss
**Problem**: AI initially lost context between conversation segments.
**Solution**: Human provided conversation summary and context reminders.

### Challenge: Complex Bug Tracing
**Problem**: The "Friend of Children" bug required understanding effect processing across multiple files and execution contexts.
**Solution**: AI used systematic grep_search to trace effect processing through the entire codebase.

### Challenge: UI/UX Understanding
**Problem**: AI needed to understand not just the technical implementation but the user experience implications.
**Solution**: Screenshots provided immediate visual context that was more effective than text descriptions.

## Key Takeaways for Human-AI Development Collaboration

### 1. Visual Context is King
Screenshots and visual examples were dramatically more effective than text descriptions for UI/UX issues. The game over dialog fix was immediately clear once the AI saw the screenshot.

### 2. Systematic Code Exploration
AI's ability to systematically search and read code files was most effective when guided by specific problem descriptions. The AI could quickly trace complex bugs across multiple files when given clear problem statements.

### 3. Iterative Refinement Works
Rather than trying to fix everything at once, the iterative approach of fix-test-refine allowed for better quality solutions and easier debugging.

### 4. Context Preservation is Critical
Maintaining context about previous fixes while working on new issues was essential. The AI needed to understand that fixes shouldn't break previous work.

### 5. Documentation Enhances Collaboration
Comprehensive summaries after each fix helped both human and AI maintain shared understanding of what was accomplished and why.

## Technical Architecture Insights

The King of Tokyo game demonstrated several architectural patterns:

### Event-Driven Game Engine
- Central game state management in `KingOfTokyoGame` class
- Event emission for UI coordination (`diceUpdated`, `playerUpdated`, etc.)
- Modal management through UIUtilities

### Effect Processing Pipeline
- Card effect definitions in `cards.js`
- Multiple processing contexts (passive, turn-based, dice-triggered)
- State tracking for effect deduplication

### UI Component Coordination
- Main UI controller in `main.js`
- Specialized components (dice, monsters, cards)
- CSS-based theming with animations

This development session showcased how human creativity and contextual understanding combined with AI's systematic code analysis and implementation capabilities can effectively solve complex software issues. The key was finding the right communication patterns and leveraging each party's strengths.

### Day 12: September 23, 2025 - Advanced AI Heuristic Expansion (Phase 10 Progress)
**Context**: Transition from foundational heuristic (pair/set centric with adaptive thresholds) toward deeper branch evaluation supporting transparency & smarter reroll strategy. Part of the Phase 10 objective list (AI transparency & decision depth) — now implementing the “deeper reroll branch evaluation” milestone.

#### Branch EV Simulation Engine
**File Modified**: `js/ai-decisions.js`
**Addition**: `_simulateBranches(state)` and integration within `_assembleDecision`.

**Purpose**: Produce marginal expected value (MEV) scores for alternative keep patterns before finalizing a reroll vs end decision.

**Key Capabilities**:

**Heuristic Adjustments**:

**Performance Considerations**:

**Outcome**:

#### Phase Progress Update

#### Next Planned Enhancements
1. Integrate power card portfolio outputs into reroll heuristics (e.g., value energy dice more when a high-impact affordable card sits in shop).
2. Accessibility pass on modals (focus trap, ESC semantics, ARIA labeling audit, live region for phase shifts & AI reasoning updates).
3. Optional probabilistic multi-roll projection (depth-2 Monte Carlo) guarded by CPU speed setting.

## Post-Rollback Baseline Establishment (September 21, 2025)
**Context**: After UI experimentation introduced instability and remote `main` diverged unexpectedly, the repository was intentionally rolled back to a stable AI-enhanced gameplay baseline. A missing victory point (VP) award on automatic forced Tokyo entry (first player condition) was restored, integrity artifacts were generated, and the remote was force-overwritten with a documented, auditable state.

### Timeline
- Previous remote `main` HEAD: `98b61e0` (captured & preserved)
- Local stabilized HEAD (with VP fix + integrity docs): `9992538`
- Safety Tag Created: `backup-pre-force-main-20250921` -> points to `98b61e0`
- Force Push: Local `main (9992538)` overwrote remote `main`
- Baseline Tag Added: `baseline-stable-2025-09-21` -> points to `9992538`

### Key Artifacts
- `docs/integrity/integrity-manifest.json` – Complete file → blob SHA mapping at baseline
- `docs/integrity/diff-summary.md` – Categorized diff vs UI branch snapshot (16 modified files)
- Git Tags:
    - `backup-pre-force-main-20250921` (recovery anchor – pre-overwrite remote)
    - `baseline-stable-2025-09-21` (canonical post-rollback reference)

### Restored Gameplay Logic
Issue: First player entering Tokyo due to all others yielding did not receive the intended +1 VP because entry was being invoked with an `automatic=true` style flag suppressing VP gain.

Resolution: `handleEndOfTurnTokyoEntry` now calls `enterTokyo(player, false)` ensuring standard VP award logic executes. This preserves intended early momentum dynamics and aligns with refactored Tokyo entry flow semantics.

### Rationale for Force Overwrite
1. Remote divergence introduced uncertainty about authoritative state.
2. UI regression experiments had reduced confidence in visual layer integrity.
3. A clean, reproducible gameplay-focused baseline was required to proceed safely.
4. Full audit trail + recovery tag mitigate risk traditionally associated with force pushing.

### Validation Steps Executed
1. Captured remote HEAD hash before overwrite.
2. Created & pushed safety tag referencing prior remote state.
3. Patched VP award logic and committed integrity artifacts.
4. Performed `git push --force-with-lease origin main`.
5. Verified remote `origin/main` == local HEAD (`9992538`).
6. Created & pushed annotated baseline tag for long-term reference.

### Integrity & Audit Guarantees
- Any future drift can be detected by regenerating a manifest and diffing against `docs/integrity/integrity-manifest.json`.
- Recovery path guaranteed via safety tag if historical forensic comparison is required.
- Baseline tag provides immutable semantic anchor for future branches (e.g., `feature/ui-refactor-from-baseline`).

### Recommended Next Hardening Steps (Deferred)
1. Add lightweight CI job to recompute manifest and alert on unexpected hash changes.
2. Introduce smoke test harness to simulate: initial roll-off → first Tokyo entry → VP verification.
3. Add unit-level test scaffolding for Tokyo entry / exit sequencing and edge elimination scenarios.
4. Document semantic contract for `enterTokyo(automaticFlag)` clarifying side-effects (VP award, log emission, event dispatch).

### Summary
The repository now has a clearly defined, integrity-documented, gameplay-correct baseline suitable for forward development without ambiguity. Future feature work should branch from `baseline-stable-2025-09-21` (or current `main`) to ensure consistent lineage.
