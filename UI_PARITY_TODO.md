## UI Parity Pipeline â€“ Task Board

Goal: Achieve reproducible, testable visual parity vs legacy implementation.

Status Legend:
âœ… Done | ðŸŸ¡ Partial / in progress | â¬œ Not started

### Phase P1 â€“ Token & Inventory â¬œ
â¬œ Extract color tokens from existing legacy CSS.
â¬œ Extract spacing scale (min, preferred, max) & map to `--space-*`.
â¬œ Extract typography (font-family, weights, sizes, line-heights) â†’ `--font-*`, `--text-*`.
â¬œ Extract radii, border, shadow, z-index layers.
â¬œ Create `tokens.css` and integrate into existing components.

### Phase P2 â€“ Snapshot & Baselines â¬œ
â¬œ Author `tools/uiAudit.js` to walk DOM and produce JSON of computed styles for key selectors.
â¬œ Define selector list in `ui-audit-selectors.json`.
â¬œ Generate baseline JSON (`/.baselines/ui-styles.json`).
â¬œ Add comparison script stub (`tools/compareAudit.js`).

### Phase P3 â€“ Visual Regression (Optional Early) â¬œ
â¬œ Decide tooling (Playwright + pixelmatch).
â¬œ Add minimal script to capture screenshots for three states: initial lobby, post-roll, post-resolve.
â¬œ Store images under `/.baselines/screenshots/`.

### Phase P4 â€“ Accessibility & Semantics â¬œ
â¬œ Add landmark roles to root container.
â¬œ Add ARIA live region for phase/log updates.
â¬œ Run axe (manual for now) and record findings.

### Phase P5 â€“ Performance Hooks â¬œ

### Phase P6 â€“ Enforcement â¬œ
### Phase 6 â€“ Player Profile Card âœ…
Deliverables Achieved:
	- Component scaffold (`player-profile-card`) with dual-class root.
	- Token-based structural CSS (`components.player-profile-card.css`).
	- Config registration (kept disabled) plus separate multi-instance manager (`player-profile-cards`).
	- Owned cards miniature lane placeholder.
	- Lightweight test harness (`player-profile-card.test.js`).
	- Manager component enabled for live multi-player rendering.
Closure Criteria Met: All planned scaffold objectives done; no redesign introduced; legacy untouched.

### Phase 7 â€“ Layout Rails & Positional Persistence ðŸŸ¡
Objectives:
	- Introduce layout rail container abstraction (players, dice/actions, log, modals staging) in modular root only.
	- Add UI slice support for persisted positions: `ui.positions[componentName] = { x, y }`.
	- Implement drag handling utility (pointer events) with throttled store writes.
	- Provide `reset positions` internal API (no legacy UI wiring yet).
	- Visual parity: maintain current stacking & approximate spacing (no redesign) while decoupling absolute positioning.
Tasks:
		âœ… Add actions: `UI_POSITION_SET`, `UI_POSITIONS_RESET`.
		âœ… Extend `ui.reducer` to handle position updates.
		âœ… Create `services/positioningService.js` for drag registration & persistence.
		âœ… Add `layout-rails.css` scaffold with rail container tokens.
		âœ… Update `player-profile-cards` container to opt into rail system.
		âœ… Provide test harness to simulate drag and assert state persistence.
		âœ… Integrate draggable persistence into dice tray.
		âœ… Add hydration & localStorage persistence.
		âœ… Add optional bounds & grid snap logic (not yet leveraged).
			âœ… Implement reset-all internal command event (`ui/positions/resetRequested`).
		â¬œ Apply positioning to second future component (e.g., action menu) after migration.
Exit Criteria:
	- Dragging a profile card updates stored position.
	- Refresh (manual test) re-applies last positions via initial mount pass.
	- Reset API clears positions and DOM transforms.

Maintainer Notes:
- Keep tasks checked off directly here, then summarize in migration plan when each Phase completes.

### Addendum (Sept 29, 2025 â€“ Parity Audit Alignment)

New Flow / Parity Tasks:
â¬œ Introduce phase FSM assertions (build lightweight dev-only validator)
âœ… Add `DICE_ROLL_RESOLVED` event & remove CPU polling loop
â¬œ Unified Yield Modal (replace heuristic/timeouts hybrid) with accessibility roles
â¬œ BUY_WAIT phase visual state (timer or dismissal CTA)
ðŸŸ¡ Timing spans (rollPhase, resolvePhase, buyPhase, cleanupPhase) captured & logged (initial spans present)
â¬œ Dev Timing Overlay component (toggle via query param or keyboard)
â¬œ AI decision rationale panel: show factor weight breakdown per last roll
â¬œ Tokyo takeover sequence visual cues (highlight attacker, flashing empty slot)
â¬œ Automatic screenshot harness states updated to include yield modal & buy phase
â¬œ Accessibility: Add live region for phase announcements & yield prompts

### Phase Beta â€“ Developer Tools Integration âœ… COMPLETED (Oct 2025)
Objectives: Provide comprehensive developer debugging and analysis tools integrated into the settings UI.

Deliverables Achieved:
	- âœ… Settings-integrated developer panel (no more floating overlays)
	- âœ… Archive Manager: Game state archiving with localStorage persistence & export/import
	- âœ… Analytics Dashboard: Real-time game statistics, performance metrics, and data visualization
	- âœ… Replay Controls: Enhanced replay system with speed adjustment (0.5x-4x), keyboard shortcuts, progress indicators
	- âœ… AI Debug Tools: AI decision tree inspection, thought bubble visualization, decision export
	- âœ… Vertical sub-tab organization: Clean UI for Archives/Analytics/Replay/AIDT sections
	- âœ… Component-based architecture: Modern modular design replacing legacy devPanel.js
	- âœ… Developer CSS styling: Responsive design with proper theming integration

Closure Criteria Met: All developer productivity tools consolidated into organized settings panel; legacy floating dev panel removed; comprehensive debugging capabilities available.

Metrics to Collect (post-implementation):
- Mean & Ïƒ of ROLL phase duration (CPU vs Human)
- Yield decision latency (AI)
- Number of stale async actions (should remain 0)

Review Trigger: Re-run visual parity audit after Phase Alpha completion (FSM + yield + timing overlay) and update baseline snapshots.
