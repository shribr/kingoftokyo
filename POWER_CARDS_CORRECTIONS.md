# Power Card Corrections - October 9, 2025

## Issue
User reported incorrect power card descriptions in the game. Giant Brain showed "you may have 2 extra cards in your hand" which is completely wrong - it should allow rolling an extra die, and there is NO hand limit in King of Tokyo.

## Source of Truth
All power card data is stored in: `/src/domain/cards.js`

## Cards Verified as Correct
- Extra Head: `{ kind: 'dice_slot', value: 1 }` ‚úÖ (same effect as Giant Brain)
- Camouflage, Complete Destruction, Corner Store, Energize, Energy Hoarder
- Evacuation Orders, Healing Ray, Herbivore
- National Guard, Nuclear Power Plant, Shrink Ray, Skyscraper
- Solar Powered, Stretch Goals, Telling Everyone, Urbavore
- We're Only Making It Stronger
- All Dark Edition cards (custom content)
- All Additional Utility cards (custom content)

## Effect Kind Changes Needed
Some cards have the wrong `effect.kind` which will need code implementation updates:

1. **Friend of Children**: Changed from `heart_energy` ‚Üí `heart_vp`
   - Need to implement this new effect kind in game logic

## Next Steps
1. ‚úÖ Update card descriptions in `/src/domain/cards.js`
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è Implement new effect kind: `heart_vp` for Friend of Children
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Verify AI card evaluation logic uses correct effect kinds
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è Test all corrected cards in-game
5. ‚ö†Ô∏è Check if legacy/cards.js needs updating (likely deprecated)

## Hand Limit Clarification
**IMPORTANT:** There is NO hand limit in King of Tokyo. The old Giant Brain description suggesting "2 extra cards in hand" implies a limit exists - this is completely false. Players can hold as many Keep cards as they want (discard cards are discarded after use).
