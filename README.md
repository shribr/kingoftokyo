## King of Tokyo ‚Äì Executive Overview

This project is a ground-up internal rebuild of the board game "King of Tokyo," used as a safe, contained sandbox to explore modern product patterns: human‚ÄìAI collaboration, deterministic simulation, observability-first design, accessibility considerations, and incremental modernization strategy. It is intentionally experiential: the value lies as much in the reusable collaboration dialog and decision trace as in the code.

### What It Is
An end‚Äëto‚Äëend playable experience (monsters, dice rolls, rerolls, Tokyo occupancy, damage, healing, victory paths, power cards) rebuilt with structured phases and AI participation hooks. The implementation emphasizes clarity of turn flow, repeatable outcomes for evaluation, and transparent decision scaffolding.

### Why It Exists
Traditional feature rewrites drift or stall because intent gets lost. Here, every major architectural move (state machine adoption, deterministic harnesses, unified decision pipeline) was co-developed alongside narrative documentation and status signaling. The result: a living artifact that demonstrates how to make AI augmentation safe, explainable, and testable before applying it to customer domains.

### Strategic Themes
1. Deterministic Foundations ‚Äì Seeded randomness + snapshot diffing enable reproducible AI and logic evaluations.
2. Explicit Phased Flow ‚Äì A finite turn/phase model replaces scattered flags, making behavior auditable and upgrade-friendly.
3. Unified Decision Points ‚Äì Collapsing divergent human vs AI logic paths reduces risk and improves explainability.
4. Observability Early ‚Äì Phase spans, timeline history, and rationale placeholders ensure insight precedes optimization.
5. Incremental Parity ‚Äì Distinguishing mechanical correctness from experiential feel guides smarter prioritization.
6. Dialog as IP ‚Äì The curated human‚ÜîAI design conversations (not just the resulting code) form a reusable modernization playbook.

### What Has Been Accomplished
‚úÖ Core gameplay loop (roll, reroll, resolve, takeover/yield decisions, buy opportunities).  
‚úÖ Structured phase machine with transition telemetry and observability.  
‚úÖ Deterministic modes for reproducible simulation and AI pathway validation.  
‚úÖ Power card catalog with purchase flow and effect queue processing.  
‚úÖ Comprehensive logging + instrumentation for phase timing and decision milestones.  
‚úÖ Modern component architecture (player panels, dice tray, modals, profile cards, action menus).  
‚úÖ **Unified yield/takeover pipeline** with enhanced modal UX and accessibility.  
‚úÖ **Dual theme system** (light/dark modes) with seamless switching.  
‚úÖ **Mobile-optimized UI** with responsive radial menus and touch-friendly controls.  
‚úÖ **Game state persistence** with auto-save (5min intervals), restore prompts, and export/import.  
‚úÖ **Settings integration** with comprehensive controls for save management and preferences.  
üü° Advanced AI rationale surfacing and personality tuning (in progress).  
‚¨ú Cloud sync and multi-slot save management (planned).  
‚¨ú Advanced AI heuristics with multi-roll EV and strategic depth (planned).  

### How To Look At This (Executive Lens)
Think of the game loop like a compressed enterprise workflow: phases ‚âà process stages; dice outcomes ‚âà event inputs; yield/buy decisions ‚âà approval or gating checkpoints. By perfecting clarity, timing, and reproducibility here, we de-risk applying similar AI augmentation and observability patterns to real customer processes (claims, supply chain steps, employee workflows).

### Reusable Outputs
- **Pattern set**: Deterministic harness, phase transition ledger, unified decision queue, state persistence with auto-save/restore.
- **Collaboration transcript motifs**: Refactor intent explanation, risk enumeration before merge, prompted rationale scaffolding, iterative UX refinement.
- **Status taxonomy** (‚úÖ / üü° / ‚¨ú / ‚ö†Ô∏è / üß™) enabling quick portfolio-level rollups and progress tracking.
- **Documentation style** blending narrative audit with concise progression signals and executive summaries.
- **Theme system architecture**: Dual-mode styling with CSS custom properties and seamless switching.
- **Mobile-first patterns**: Touch-optimized controls, responsive layouts, and progressive enhancement.
- **Persistence patterns**: Auto-save with custom confirmation modals, export/import, and settings integration.

### Near-Term Focus
- Expand AI decision rationale into structured, test-assertable metadata.
- Broaden effect processing and card breadth for rule depth parity.
- Enhance accessibility semantics across all interactive components.
- Introduce cloud sync and multi-slot save management.
- Performance optimization for mobile devices and complex game states.

### How To Contribute
Playtest, propose clarity or pacing improvements, enhance accessibility, add rationale surfacing, or help formalize dialog pattern extraction. Light, well-scoped contribution lanes are maintained to keep onboarding fast.

### Where The Original Technical Detail Went
The prior, deeply technical README is preserved at \`docs/README.technical.backup.md\`. Additional implementation roadmaps and audits:  
- \`docs/IMPLEMENTATION_TODO.md\` (canonical execution tracker)  
- \`docs/GAME_FLOW_PARITY_AUDIT.md\` (experience & timing parity)  
- \`docs/RULES_PARITY.md\` (rules coverage & dimension matrix)  
- \`docs/UI_PARITY_TODO.md\` (visual / interaction alignment tasks)  
- \`docs/GAME_STATE_PERSISTENCE.md\` (auto-save system & persistence architecture)  
- \`docs/IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md\` (recent feature completions & enhancements)  

### Guiding Principle
Code is transient; the structured methodology and dialog that generated it are the durable, reusable asset.
