- [ ] **Complex effect engine** - Only basic effects work (VP gain, energy gain)
- [ ] **Card interaction system** - Cards that modify other cards
- [ ] **Effect timing and stacking** - When multiple cards interact
- [ ] **Discard vs Keep mechanics** - Full implementation of both types
- [ ] **Targeted effects** - Cards that target specific players
- [ ] **Conditional effects** - Cards with "if" conditions

### AI Decision System (HIGH PRIORITY ‚Äì Strategic Depth)  
- [ ] **Strategic decision making** - Multi-turn planning
- [ ] **Personality-based behavior** - Different monster personalities
- [ ] **Card purchase intelligence** - Smart card buying decisions
- [ ] **Risk assessment** - Tokyo stay/leave decisions
- [ ] **Dice keep strategy** - Optimal dice keeping logic

#### AI Infrastructure Unification (NEW ‚Äì Precedes Depth Expansion)
- [x] Deprecated duplicate enhanced AI file (formerly `new/js/ai-decisions.js`) ‚Äì unified on single engine; legacy snapshots retained under `src/legacy/`.
- [ ] Remove scheduled auto-keep timer path from `aiDecisionService.js` (controller becomes sole actuator).
- [ ] Introduce perception layer (`buildAIState(storeState, activePlayerId)`) ‚Äì pure extract; eliminate reducer global peeks.
- [ ] Deterministic engine mode (seed + fixed Monte Carlo trial count) under `TEST_MODE` flag.
- [ ] Replace purchase heuristic with portfolio optimizer advisory wrapper.
- [ ] Integrate yield advisory via engine projection (single rationale channel).
- [ ] Effect queue virtual state adapter (pending heals/damage influence risk posture).
- [ ] Decision node labeling (`source`, `factors[]`, `confidence`).
- [ ] Telemetry schema unification (`ai.decision`, `ai.yield`, `ai.purchasePlan`).

### Game Flow & Timing Integrity (ELEVATED TO HIGH)
- [x] Phase finite state machine (legal transition table) ‚Äì baseline implemented (`phaseFSM.js`) + controller utilities (`phaseController.js`).
- [x] `turnCycleId` concurrency guard (baseline: meta.turnCycleId + guard utilities adopted in CPU turn & watchdog).
- [ ] Phase controller adoption (migrate direct `phaseChanged` dispatches in services to centralized API).
- [ ] Extended concurrency adoption (apply guard to effect queue processing & UI pacing timers).
- [ ] Event-based dice completion (`DICE_ROLL_RESOLVED`) ‚Äì remove polling loops
- [ ] Minimum phase duration enforcement (ROLL / RESOLVE / BUY_WAIT)
- [ ] Unified yield decision modal (human) + deterministic AI decision promise
- [ ] BUY_WAIT explicit phase (user ends or timeout)
- [ ] Timing span instrumentation + dev overlay (phase durations, reroll latency)
- [ ] Structured takeover sequence tests (attacks ‚Üí yield ‚Üí takeover)
- [ ] **Animation system** - Smooth transitions and feedback
- [ ] **Sound effects** - Audio feedback for actions
- [ ] **Error handling** - Graceful error recovery
- [ ] **Edge case handling** - Unusual game state management
- [ ] **Performance optimization** - Smooth gameplay
- [ ] **Mobile responsiveness** - Touch-friendly interface

## Deterministic Mode (UPDATED)
**Purpose**: Reproducible dice + AI decision outcomes for CI & regression analysis.

**Activation**: `window.__KOT_TEST_MODE__ = true` (browser) or `KOT_TEST_MODE=1` (env).

**Behavior Changes Implemented**:
1. Monte Carlo trial count fixed to 64.
2. Seeded RNG (Mulberry32) for dice: seed = combineSeed('KOT_DICE', turnCycleId, rollIndex, playerId).
3. Seeded RNG for AI decisions: seed = combineSeed('KOT_AI', turnCycleId, decisionIndex, playerId).
4. Decision object now includes `deterministic: { seed, trials, turnCycleId, decisionIndex }`.
5. Profiling remains optional; deterministic mode does not auto-disable it yet (future improvement: freeze adaptive responses entirely).

**Pending Enhancements**:
- Seeded shop card ordering.
- Replay export (seed + state diff stream).
- Deterministic card effect resolution ordering assertions.

**Smoke Harness**: `tools/deterministicSmoke.js` validates stable dice + decision object across two runs.

**Note**: Revisions incorporate parity audit findings (Sept 29, 2025). Legacy remains the reference standard until Flow Parity (Phase Alpha) is achieved.
